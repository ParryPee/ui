description: Getting started with 8StarLabs UI
---

Installing the 8StarLabs UI components is simple with the shadcn/ui CLI. You can add any component from our library to your Next.js project using the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.8starlabs.io/r/<component>.json
```

## Prerequisites

Before installing 8StarLabs UI, ensure your environment meets these requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 or later
- A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) setup in your project. If you don't have it setup, running any install command will set it up for you.

## Installing Components

You can install 8StarLabs UI components using the `shadcn/ui` CLI which adds the selected component’s code and any needed dependencies to your project.

The CLI will download the component's code and integrate it into your project's directory (usually under your components folder).

After running the command, you should see a confirmation in your terminal that the files were added. You can then proceed to use the component in your code.
