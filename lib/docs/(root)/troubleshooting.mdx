## Why are my components not styled?

Make sure your project is configured correctly for shadcn/ui in Tailwind 4 - this means having a `globals.css` file that imports Tailwind and includes the shadcn/ui base styles.

## The component imports fail with “module not found”

Check the file exists. If it does, make sure your tsconfig.json has a proper paths alias for @/ i.e.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/_": ["./_"]
    }
  }
}
```
