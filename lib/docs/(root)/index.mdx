# Getting Started

8StarLabs UI is a component library and custom registry built on top of shadcn/ui to help you build beautiful frontend experiences faster. It provides pre-built components that are niche and unique.

Components are available via the `npx shadcn@latest add` command.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.8starlabs.io/r/<component>.json
```

For example, to install the Status Indicator component, you can run:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.8starlabs.io/r/status-indicator.json
```
